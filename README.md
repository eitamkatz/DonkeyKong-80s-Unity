# Project 3: 80â€™s

DONKEY KONG

Screen resolution: 16x9
## Scope
- the first level of the game.

## Intervention
My intervention is to make Donkey Kong a challenging game. 
  (I added the shoots because in the play-tests i had people said that it's too hard)
-Bad Intervention for the player:
  - portals - moves the character from one place to another.
  - unreal ladders - there is some ladders that the character can't climb of, they disappear when the character touch them. 
  - Falling Breaks - there is Falling Breaks that the character can fall from.
- Good intervention for the player:
  - magic hammer - knock down the donkey kong barrels for 7 seconds. (good intervention but still frustrating =) )
  - shoots - the character can shoot up every 1 second (with the left-shift key). 
          (also good intervention but the character can take a hit also so still frustrating...  =) )
  - shield - defensing from barrels for 3 seconds (I added it to confuse the player because the shield and the portals are with the same sprit!).


## Mechanics
- Character
    - movement:
      - The character can move to the right and to the left
      - The character can jump for three direction - up, left-up, right-up, the character can't change the direction while jumping.
      - The character can climb on the ladders up and down, can't move left or right will climbing.
  -Feathers:
    - The character can throw the hammer over donkey kong to knock him down for 7 seconds.
    - The character can shoots bullets to destroy the barrels.
    - The character can take a shield.

- Donkey Kong
    - Donkey Kong throw barrels and magic barrels. 

- Paulina:
  - screams for help.
  - When the character gets to her the game ends (win condition).
  
- enemies:
  - Barrels
    - The barrels roll down the path.
    - The barrels sometimes go down the ladders (~AI).
    
  - Magic barrels
    - The magic barrels movement identical to the regular barrels.
    - The magic barrels create fireballs that climb up the path to donkey kong.

  - Fireballs
    - The fireballs go to Donkey Kong
      - They move right and left in the ground.
      - They move up the Ladders to Donkey Kong.

- score:
	- Jumping over a barrel adds 100 to the score.
    - Destroying a barrels (shoot them) adds 500 to the score.
